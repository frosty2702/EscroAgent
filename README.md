TrustFlow: Programmable Payments. Powered by Autonomous Agents.
üåü Overview
TrustFlow is a cutting-edge decentralized escrow platform built on Base Sepolia that redefines conditional payments. It leverages immutable smart contracts and an intelligent autonomous agent to enable secure, transparent, and automated agreements between parties, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries and the inherent trust issues they present. TrustFlow is not just an application; it's a new financial primitive designed for the decentralized future.

üéØ The Problem TrustFlow Solves
Centralized Trust & Intermediary Risk: Traditional escrow relies on a trusted third party, introducing a single point of failure, potential bias, and high fees. Many blockchain escrows still require manual multisig or manual intervention for fund release.

TrustFlow's Solution: We eliminate the need for a central intermediary. Funds are secured in immutable smart contracts, and fund release is governed by code and an autonomous agent, ensuring trustless execution.

Lack of Automation & Efficiency: Existing systems often involve manual verification of conditions (e.g., "was the task done?"), leading to delays, human error, and prolonged dispute periods.

TrustFlow's Solution: Our autonomous agent continuously monitors pre-defined off-chain conditions (like dates, task completions, GitHub PR merges, API responses, or custom events). When conditions are met, the agent automatically triggers on-chain settlement, ensuring swift and unbiased fund release.

Monetization & Scalability for Web3 Protocols: Building a sustainable Web3 business often struggles with a clear, low-friction monetization model.

TrustFlow's Solution: We've integrated x402pay directly into our protocol. A small, transparent fee (0.0005 ETH) is charged at the point of escrow creation, allowing TrustFlow to generate revenue from every new agreement. This completes the vital "money-in" loop, demonstrating a viable and scalable business model.

Complex UX & Limited Extensibility in dApps: Many dApps sacrifice user experience for functionality, and often provide a narrow scope of use.

TrustFlow's Solution: We deliver a beautiful, intuitive, and mobile-optimized UI/UX that makes complex blockchain interactions simple. Furthermore, our system is designed with composable primitives (diverse condition types) that lay the groundwork for building more complex financial patterns (like recurring payments, milestone-based grants, or dynamic bounties), making TrustFlow a platform for programmable payments.

Deploy Smart Contracts (If not already deployed by an agent):

Important: This step requires testnet ETH in the wallet corresponding to the PRIVATE_KEY in contracts/.env.

Navigate to the contracts/ directory.

Run the deployment script:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network baseSepolia

SAVE THE DEPLOYED EscrowFactory ADDRESS! You will need to update ESCROW_FACTORY_ADDRESS in agent/.env.local and frontend/src/config/contracts.ts with this new address.

Update Frontend & Agent with New Factory Address:

After deployment, manually update the ESCROW_FACTORY_ADDRESS in:

agent/.env.local

frontend/src/config/contracts.ts (find ESCROW_FACTORY_ADDRESS)

Clean Frontend Cache:

cd frontend
rm -rf .next

How to Run the App
Start the Frontend:

cd frontend
npm run dev
# Access the app at http://localhost:3000

Start the Autonomous Agent:

Open a new terminal window.

  cd agent
  npm start

(Keep this terminal running in the background to monitor agreement settlements)

How to Use TrustFlow
Getting Testnet ETH for Your Coinbase Smart Wallet
Your TrustFlow app is designed to connect with your Coinbase Smart Wallet (CDP Wallet). This wallet type often generates a unique address per dApp (e.g., 0x2841D2953b5d165D18Ba09baa003719B2Fdfa2e1 for your account). You need to fund this specific address from a faucet.

Copy Your Smart Wallet Address: When you connect your Coinbase Wallet to http://localhost:3000, the address displayed in the UI will be your Smart Wallet address (e.g., 0x2841...a2e1). Copy this address.

Go to a Faucet:

Chainlink Faucet: https://faucets.chain.link/

QuickNode Faucet: https://faucet.quicknode.com/base/sepolia

Request ETH: Select "Base Sepolia" and paste your Smart Wallet address (0x2841...a2e1) into the address field. Request ETH.

Creating and Settling an Agreement
Connect Wallet: Go to http://localhost:3000 and click "Connect Wallet." Select Coinbase Wallet. Confirm connection and that your Smart Wallet balance is displayed.

Create Agreement:

Navigate to the "Create Agreement" section.

Fill in the Payee Address (any test address you control, or even your x402pay fee collector address for testing).

Enter an Amount (e.g., 0.01 ETH).

Choose a Condition Type (e.g., "Specific Date" for easy testing, set a date/time a few minutes in the future).

Add a Description.

Observe: Note that the total amount to be sent includes the escrow amount plus the 0.0005 ETH x402pay creation fee.

Submit the transaction and confirm in your Coinbase Wallet.

Verify Creation Fee on BaseScan: Copy the transaction hash from your wallet. Go to BaseScan Sepolia and search for the transaction. Confirm that 0.0005 ETH was sent from your wallet to the x402pay fee address (0xfB470D35B311C15CFdc3142318eEaB2016c90914).

Monitor Dashboard: Your new agreement will appear in the "Active Agreements" dashboard.

Autonomous Settlement: Wait for the condition to be met (e.g., specific date passes). Observe your agent's terminal logs as it detects the condition and initiates the settlement transaction.

Verify Settlement Fee on BaseScan: Find the agent's settlement transaction on BaseScan Sepolia. Confirm that 0.001 ETH was sent from the Escrow contract to the x402pay fee address (0xfB470D35B311C15CFdc3142318eEaB2016c90914). The remaining escrow amount goes to the payee.
